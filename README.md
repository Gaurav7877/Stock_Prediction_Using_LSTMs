# Stock Prediction Using LSTMs
I created a stock price prediction system by analyzing over 13 years of data, using advanced techniques, and building an accurate machine-learning model. The model generated predictions closely aligned with actual stock prices.

# Methodology
1) Scrapped stock data from Yahoo Finance and imported essential libraries
2) Used 100 & 200 day moving averages using "matplotlib" to visualize stock analysis techniques
3) Performed preprocessing using the "sklearn" library and its various modules such that a machine learning model would accept the dataset and effectively train from it
4) Trained a 9-layer sequential machine learning model containing alternating LSTM and Dropout layers and a dense layer
5) Generated a set of predicted values that have a close relation to the actual stock prices when plotted on a graph
